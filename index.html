                <img src="./images/players/player-1.png" alt="Neymar JR">
                <h2>Neymar JR</h2>
                <p>Neymar, in full Neymar da Silva Santos, Jr., (born February 5, 1992, Mogi das Cruzes, Brazil),
                    Brazilian football (soccer) player who was one of the most prolific scorers in his country’s storied
                    football history.

                    Neymar began playing football as a boy in São Vicente, under the guidance of his father, a former
                    professional footballer who remained a close adviser and mentor throughout his son’s career. Having
                    played street and indoor five-a-side football, Neymar joined Portuguesa Santista’s youth team in São
                    Vicente, and in 2003 he and his family moved to Santos. There Neymar, who was already an impressive
                    player, joined the youth academy of Santos FC (the same club for which Brazilian football legend
                    Pelé starred over the majority of his domestic career). At age 14 he had a successful trial with
                    Spain’s Real Madrid, and Santos had to increase its spending to retain him.

                    Neymar—a slender-framed 5-foot 9-inch (1.75-metre) forward—was supremely confident on the field,
                    with excellent body control, quick reflexes, and explosive speed. He made his first team debut with
                    Santos in 2009. While playing with Santos, he averaged a goal every other match and helped the team
                    win the Libertadores Cup (the most prestigious South American club competition) in 2011. Neymar’s
                    many individual honours with Santos included the South American Footballer of the Year title in 2011
                    and 2012.</p>

                <img src="./images/players/player-2.png" alt="Lionel Messi">
                <h2>Lionel Messi</h2>
                <p>Lionel Messi, in full Lionel Andrés Messi, also called Leo Messi, (born June 24, 1987, Rosario,
                    Argentina), Argentine-born football (soccer) player who was named Fédération Internationale de
                    Football Association (FIFA) world player of the year five times (2009–12 and 2015).Messi started
                    playing football as a boy and in 1995 joined the youth team of Newell’s Old Boys (a Rosario-based
                    top-division football club). Messi’s phenomenal skills garnered the attention of prestigious clubs
                    on both sides of the Atlantic. At age 13 Messi and his family relocated to Barcelona, and he began
                    playing for FC Barcelona’s under-14 team. He scored 21 goals in 14 games for the junior team, and he
                    quickly graduated through the higher-level teams until at age 16 he was given his informal debut
                    with FC Barcelona in a friendly match.

                    In the 2004–05 season Messi, then 17, became the youngest official player and goal scorer in the
                    Spanish La Liga (the country’s highest division of football). Though only 5 feet 7 inches (1.7
                    metres) tall and weighing 148 pounds (67 kg), he was strong, well-balanced, and versatile on the
                    field. Naturally left-footed, quick, and precise in control of the ball, Messi was a keen pass
                    distributor and could readily thread his way through packed defenses. In 2005 he was granted Spanish
                    citizenship, an honour greeted with mixed feelings by the fiercely Catalan supporters of Barcelona.
                    The next year Messi and Barcelona won the Champions League (the European club championship) title.

                <img src="./images/players/player-3.png" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo">
                <h2>Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>
                <p>Cristiano Ronaldo, in full Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro, (born February 5, 1985, Funchal,
                    Madeira, Portugal), Portuguese football (soccer) forward who was one of the greatest players of his
                    generation.
                    Ronaldo’s father, José Dinis Aveiro, was the equipment manager for the local club Andorinha. (The
                    name Ronaldo was added to Cristiano’s name in honour of his father’s favourite movie actor, Ronald
                    Reagan, who was U.S. president at the time of Cristiano’s birth.) At age 15 Ronaldo was diagnosed
                    with a heart condition that necessitated surgery, but he was sidelined only briefly and made a full
                    recovery. He first played for Clube Desportivo Nacional of Madeira and then transferred to Sporting
                    Clube de Portugal (known as Sporting Lisbon), where he played for that club’s various youth teams
                    before making his debut on Sporting’s first team in 2002.

                    A tall player at 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 metres), Ronaldo was a formidable athlete on the pitch.
                    Originally a right-winger, he developed into a forward with a free-reined attacking style. He was
                    able to mesmerize opponents with a sleight of foot that made sufficient space for openings in
                    opposing defenses.

                <img src="./images/players/player-4.png" alt="Paulo Dybala">
                <h2>Paulo Dybala</h2>
                <p>Paulo Dybala: The boy from the town "where dreams seem unreachable" who became a global superstar
                    Laguna Larga is an unassuming Argentine town of no more than 6,000 inhabitants.

                    Down a long stretch of highway sits the nearest large city, Cordoba, and Paulo Dybala's father,
                    Adolfo, would drive the promising young footballer on the 140 kilometer round trip so he could train
                    at the academy of the region's professional team, Instituto.
                    Few countries in the world have a passion for football quite like Argentina -- Dybala jokes that
                    "when you are born, first they give you a ball, and then a dummy" -- and like almost every other
                    child in the country, he dreamed of becoming a footballer.
                    After Adolfo, it was Instituto that first noticed Dybala's prodigious talent and offered the lithe
                    teenager a place in the club's youth system.
                    Cordoba in itself can often seem a world away from Laguna Larga, so for Dybala to have made it to
                    Juventus and the Argentine national team -- and played alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi,
                    the two greatest players of his generation -- is, in his words, "unthinkable."
                    "The truth is, I never imagined I'd reach such heights," Dybala tells CNN in an exclusive interview
                    ahead of Serie A's restart on June 20, with Juventus' first game away at Bologna on June 22.

                <h2>Mesut Özil</h2>
                <p>Everything started with a tweet. Mesut Özil knew the risks, in December last year, when he decided to
                    offer a startling, public denunciation both of China’s treatment of the Uighurs, a largely Muslim
                    minority in the region of Xinjiang, and the complicit silence of the international community.

                    Friends and advisers had warned Özil, the Arsenal midfielder, that there would be consequences. He
                    would have to write off China as a market. His six million followers on Weibo, the country’s largest
                    social network, would disappear. His fan club there — with as many as 50,000 signed-up members —
                    would go, too. He would never play in China. He might become too toxic even for any club with
                    Chinese owners, or sponsors eager to do business there.

                    Özil knew this was not fearmongering. He was aware of China’s furious response — both
                    institutionally and organically — to a tweet by Daryl Morey, the general manager of the N.B.A.’s
                    Houston Rockets, only a few weeks earlier. Yet Özil was adamant. He had been growing increasingly
                    outraged by the situation in Xinjiang for months, watching documentaries, consuming news reports. He
                    believed it was his duty, he told his advisers, not so much to highlight the issue but to pressure
                    Muslim-majority nations — including Turkey, whose president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had served as
                    best man at Özil’s wedding — to intercede.

                    And so he pressed send.

                    How much of what followed can be traced back to that tweet is contested. Özil is convinced that is
                    the moment everything changed. Arsenal is just as adamant that it is not. There is no easy, neat way
                    of bridging the divide between those perspectives. Perhaps both are true. Perhaps neither is.
                    Neither Özil nor Arsenal was willing to discuss their differences on the record.</p>

                <p>Argentine footballers, wherever they are in the world, show their innate talent in football. In the
                    following article, we would read Mauro Icardi Biography, Inter Milan's eighth highest goalscorer of
                    all time.
                    Mauro Icardi Just like a student, climbed the ladder of success one by one that now plays at the
                    highest level of world football in one of the best leagues in Europe. Many may criticize him, but no
                    one can deny the talent of this 28-year-old Argentine.Mauro Icardi was not even 10 years old when he
                    started his amateur football career. During his football career, he had played in Italy, Spain, and
                    France and although he could have played for the Italian national team, he preferred to play for the
                    national team of the country where he grew up. Maybe in recent years, some know Icardi by his
                    controversies. But the world of football has always been full of such events, and what keeps a
                    player in people's minds is the fascinating technique and memorable games, that Icardi has proven

                <img src="./images/players/player-7.png" alt="Ángel Di María">
                <h2>Ángel Di María</h2>
                <p> Ángel Di María once admitted that he sought out a psychologist to help him deal with the trauma of
                    his performance in finals. He overcame that stigma on Saturday with the goal that gave Argentina a
                    1-0 victory over Brazil in the final of the Copa America at the Maracana Stadium.

                    “I can’t cry, I can’t fall, we dreamed so much of achieving this. So many people said I shouldn’t
                    come back, I kept banging my head against the wall and today it happened,” the veteran winger said
                    after the match in Rio de Janeiro. His goal gave Argentina its first major title in 28 years.

                    Argentina’s winner came in the 22nd minute after Rodrigo de Paul made a long pass to Di Maria. The
                    33-year-old striker counted on poor defending by Brazil left-back Renan Lodi to take control and lob
                    it past goalkeeper Ederson.

                    Di Maria, captain Lionel Messi and striker Sergio Agüero are the sole survivors of the squad that
                    lost the 2014 World Cup final in Brazil. They also experienced defeat against Chile in the deciders
                    of Copa America in 2015 and 2016.</p>

                <img src="./images/players/player-8.png" alt="Kylian Mbappé">
                <h2>Kylian Mbappé</h2>
                <p>At 19, France's Kylian Mbappe has been deemed the next great player of his generation, the Messi or
                    Ronaldo for an entirely new era of fans.

                    "If you gave me a billion [euros], I wouldn't sell him," Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser
                    Al-Khelaifi said of Mbappe in May.

                    "He is part of the group of five or six top players that will soon dominate the world," Arsene
                    Wenger, the legendary French football manager who led Arsenal for over two decades, said in June.

                    But Mbappe is more than the future. He's an international star right now. He's the catalyst for
                    France, the dynamic superstar who succeeded where both Messi and Ronaldo have failed: bring home a
                    World Cup. He may be young, but his arrival on the international stage has been nothing short of a
                    superstar's coming-out party. When he left Monaco for PSG last August, his €145 million transfer fee
                    was enough to make him the second-most expensive player in the world (behind Neymar Jr.). In his
                    first season playing in Paris, Mbappe's showing was strong; he scored 21 goals and assisted on 16
                    more.</p>

                <img src="./images/players/player-9.png" alt="Mohamed Salah">
                <h2>Mohamed Salah</h2>
                <p>Mohamed Salah Hamed Mahrous Ghaly, is an Egyptian professional footballer who plays as a forward for
                    Premier League club Liverpool and captains the Egypt national team. Considered one of the best
                    players in the world,[6][7] he is known for his finishing, dribbling, and speed.

                    Salah started his senior career with Egyptian club Al Mokawloon, departing shortly thereafter to
                    join Swiss side Basel for an undisclosed fee. In Switzerland, his performances attracted Premier
                    League side Chelsea, who signed him in 2014 for a reported fee of £11 million. However, he was used
                    sparingly in his debut season and was allowed to leave on loan to Serie A clubs Fiorentina and Roma,
                    with the latter eventually signing him permanently for €15 million. Following his role in helping
                    Roma to a second-placed finish and a club record points-tally in 2017, Salah returned to the Premier
                    League to sign for Liverpool for a then club-record fee of £36.9 million.

                    In his second spell in England, Salah adapted his game from a natural winger to a forward, and he
                    netted 32 goals in 36 league games in his debut season, winning the Premier League Golden Boot and
                    breaking the Premier League scoring record for a 38-game season. Salah's performances earned him a
                    number of individual accolades, including the PFA Players' Player of the Year. He also came third in
                    the 2018 Best FIFA Men's Player award. The following season, he finished as the Premier League's
                    joint-top goalscorer and helped Liverpool win the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League, scoring in the
                    final. In his third season at the club, he helped the team win the 2019–20 Premier League, which
                    ended the club's 30-year league title drought.

                    At international level, Salah represented Egypt at youth level before making his senior debut in
                    2011. Following his performances at the 2012 Summer Olympics, he was named CAF Most Promising
                    African Talent of the Year. Since then, he has helped Egypt reach the final of the 2017 Africa Cup
                    of Nations, and was top scorer during CAF qualification to help the team qualify for the 2018 FIFA
                    World Cup. Salah has been named the CAF African Footballer of the Year (2017 and 2018), BBC African
                    Footballer of the Year (2017 and 2018), and was selected in the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations Team of
                    the Tournament and the CAF Team of the Year on several occasions</p>

                <img src="./images/players/player-10.png" alt="Harry Kane">
                <h2>Harry Kane</h2>
                <p>Harry Edward Kane MBE (born 28 July 1993) is an English professional footballer who plays as a
                    striker for Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur and captains the England national team. Regarded
                    as one of the best strikers in the world, Kane is known for his prolific goalscoring record and
                    ability to link play.[4][5]

                    Born and raised in the London borough of Waltham Forest, Kane began his career at Tottenham Hotspur,
                    where, after fast progression through the team's youth academy, he was promoted to the senior team
                    in 2009, at age 16. He did not initially feature for the side, and was loaned out several times to
                    clubs across the English football pyramid, including Leyton Orient, Millwall, Leicester City, and
                    Norwich City. Kane's involvement at Tottenham began to increase following the arrival of Mauricio
                    Pochettino as head coach in 2014. In his first full season at the club, Kane scored 31 goals across
                    all competitions, was the Premier League's second-highest goalscorer, and was named PFA Young Player
                    of the Year.

                    In the 2015–16 and 2016–17 seasons, Kane finished as the league's top goalscorer. In the latter
                    campaign, he helped Tottenham finish as the competition's runners-up and won the PFA Fans' Player of
                    the Year award. Kane registered his best campaign statistically to date in the 2017–18 season, with
                    41 goals scored in 48 games across all competitions, and in the following season, he finished as a
                    runner-up in the UEFA Champions League. In February 2021, he became Tottenham's second-highest
                    all-time goalscorer in official competitions. He ended the 2020–21 season as the top goalscorer and
                    top assist provider in the league.

                    Kane has scored 38 goals in 60 games for England. He appeared and scored at every youth level, and
                    made a goalscoring debut with the senior team in March 2015, aged 21. Kane featured and scored
                    during England's successful UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying, and represented the country at the tournament
                    itself. He was made the squad's captain from May 2018, before the 2018 FIFA World Cup. In that
                    tournament Kane finished as the World Cup's top goalscorer, winning the Golden Boot, leading England
                    to fourth place, their highest finish since 1990.[6] He also led England to second place at the 2020
                    UEFA European Championship, marking their first appearance in a final at the tournament and their
                    first major final since 1966.[7]</p>

                <h2>Kevin De Bruyne</h2>
                <p>Kevin De Bruyne (born 28 June 1991) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder
                    for Premier League club Manchester City, where he is vice-captain, and the Belgium national team. He
                    is one of just three players (the others being Cristiano Ronaldo and Thierry Henry) to have won the
                    PFA Players' Player of the Year award back to back, and the only midfielder and Belgium player to
                    have done so in English football history.[5]

                    De Bruyne began his career at Genk, where he was a regular player when they won the 2010–11 Belgian
                    Pro League. In 2012, he joined English club Chelsea, where he was used sparingly and then loaned to
                    Werder Bremen. He signed with Wolfsburg for £18 million in 2014, where he established himself as one
                    of the best players in the Bundesliga and was integral in the club's 2014–15 DFB-Pokal win. In the
                    summer of 2015, De Bruyne joined Manchester City for a club record £54 million. He has since won
                    three Premier League titles, five League Cups and an FA Cup with the club. In 2017–18, he had a
                    significant role in Manchester City's record in becoming the only Premier League team to attain 100
                    points in a single season. In 2019–20, De Bruyne tied the record for most assists in a Premier
                    League season and was awarded Player of the Season.

                    De Bruyne made his full international debut in 2010, and he has since earned over 80 caps and scored
                    22 goals for Belgium. He was a member of the Belgian squads that reached the quarter-finals both at
                    the 2014 FIFA World Cup and at UEFA Euro 2016. He represented Belgium at the 2018 FIFA World Cup,
                    where Belgium won the third place play-off match against England, and was named in the FIFA World
                    Cup Dream Team.

                    De Bruyne has been named in the UEFA Champions League Squad of the Season four times, the IFFHS
                    Men's World Team, the UEFA Team of the Year and the ESM Team of the Year three times each, the
                    France Football World XI, and the Bundesliga Team of the Year. He has also won the Premier League
                    Playmaker of the Season twice, Manchester City's Player of the Season three times, the PFA Players'
                    Player of the Year twice, the UEFA Champions League Midfielder of the Season, the Bundesliga Player
                    of the Year, the Footballer of the Year (Germany), the Belgian Sportsman of the Year and the IFFHS

                <h2>Philippe Coutinho</h2>
                <p>Philippe Coutinho Correia (born 12 June 1992) is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as an
                    attacking midfielder or winger for Spanish club Barcelona and the Brazil national team. He is known
                    for his combination of vision, passing, dribbling and ability to conjure curving long-range
                    strikes.[4]

                    Born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Coutinho showed prodigious talent and excelled in Vasco da Gama's
                    youth system. He was signed by Italian club Inter Milan in 2008 for €4 million and subsequently
                    loaned back to Vasco, where he became a key player. He made his debut for Inter Milan in 2010, and
                    was later loaned to La Liga club Espanyol in 2012. In January 2013, Coutinho joined English club
                    Liverpool for £8.5 million. He flourished at Liverpool, being named in the PFA Team of the Year in
                    2015.[5][6] In January 2018, Coutinho signed for Barcelona for a club record fee reportedly worth
                    €160 million (making him the world's second most expensive player at the time),[7] and won two La
                    Liga titles. However, he was loaned to German club Bayern Munich on a season-long loan ahead of the
                    2019–20 season, being a part of the team that won a treble including the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and
                    UEFA Champions League.[8]

                    Coutinho made his senior international debut in 2010. He was part of the Brazilian squad at the 2015
                    Copa América, the Copa América Centenario in 2016, and made his World Cup debut at the 2018 FIFA
                    World Cup where he scored two goals and was named to the FIFA World Cup Dream Team; he was also a
                    member of the Brazilian team that won the 2019 Copa América on home soil.</p>

                <h2>Jan Oblak </h2>
                <p>Jan Oblak remains the benchmark for goalkeeping excellence. The Slovenian has conceded the lowest number of goals in La Liga this season as Atletico Madrid have led the way for the majority of the campaign. 
                    The Slovenian also boasts the best save percentage in the league, with a ridiculous 84.2% of attempts pushed away from danger. His whopping 75% penalty save ratio (from four attempts) is also evidence of the aura he now carries - strikers quake in their boots when they come face to face with the 6ft2 custodian. 
                    He is great on the ball, good in the area, positionally excellent, strong and a great communicator. Nobody else even comes close. 
                    </p>

                <h2>Ederson </h2>
                <p>In an age where goalkeepers are required to participate in build-up play, few no.1s can rival Manchester City’s Brazilian goalkeeper. Whether knocking it first time to Fernandinho between two on-rushing attackers or pinging it 60-yards onto Raheem Sterling’s big toe, Ederson is adept at getting City on the front foot, whatever the scenario.
                    He's massively improved from a defensive standpoint this season too. Whereas he boasted only the 12th best save percentage last campaign, that's up to third this term. The 27-year-old also has the most clean sheets in the Premier League so far this season, with 18. 
                    </p>

                <h2>Manuel Neuer </h2>
                <p>It wasn’t long ago that people were talking about Manuel Neuer in the past tense. A player who finished third in the 2014 Ballon d’Or voting began to struggle towards the end of the decade with recurring foot injuries. Things took their toll on the Bayern and Germany captain, leading to repeated calls for Neuer to be replaced in the national team by Marc Andre ter Stegen. 

                    But all of those doubts and concerns were banished last season, as Neuer - back to his confident best - inspired Bayern to a treble. Neuer boasts the fifth highest save percentage in the German top flight and the highest pass completion, proving he is a real asset to Bayern's attacking play as well as a fine stopper. 
                    
                    On his day, there is still nobody better than Manuel Neuer. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="player">
                <img src="./images/goalkeepers/4.jpg" alt="">
                <h2>Thibaut Courtois </h2>
                <p>It almost seems funny to recall that Thibault Courtois looked a little out of his depth after joining Real Madrid in 2019. The Belgian got over his bumpy start and has reaffirmed his status as one of the most feared stoppers in world football, helping the side to La Liga glory last season and playing a big role in this year's title charge. 
                    The Belgian boasts the second-best save percentage in La Liga, stopping 76.6% of the attempts he’s faced, and conceded just 24 goals in 34 matches, the third best in the division. Like the aforementioned Mendy, Courtois was sensational in the second-leg of the Champions League semi-final between Madrid and Chelsea. Without the four or five incredible saves, the game would have been dead and buried by half time. Those are the moments that set the vert best goalkeepers apart and Courtois proved he belongs to that group. At just 28, he is only just hitting him prime as a goalkeeper and may actually be improving too.
                    He will be hoping to inspire Belgium to glory at Euro 2020 this summer.
                    </p>

                <h2>Edouard Mendy </h2>
                <p>Unsatisfied with Kepa's performances last season, Chelsea moved quickly to snap up former Rennes No.1 Edouard Mendy last summer. It's proved inspired business, especially given the relatively cheap £22m he cost the Blues. 
                    In his debut Premier League campaign, Mendy ranks second in the division for both accurate passes and clean sheets - not bad for a player getting to grips with a new language in a new country. 
                    Like all the best stoppers, Mendy saves his best performances for the biggest stage of all. The 29-year-old proved the difference between victory and defeat in the Champions League semi-final second leg against Real Madrid. While Chelsea were the better side throughout, it was the Senegalese's lightning reactions which prevented Karim Benzema from scoring on two occasions. He has developed into one of Europe's top stoppers at Stamford Bridge, and is only going to improve next season.

                <h2>Alisson</h2>
                <p>It's been a trying season for Liverpool, who have fallen well short of their usual lofty standards. Virgil Van Dijk's absence has caused chaos in an erstwhile solid backline, yet Alisson has been his reliable self between the posts. His 73% save ratio is the sixth highest in the Premier League, while his passing accuracy (85%) is the highest among first choice 'keepers. 
                    Not only a gifted shot-stopper, but also a great organiser and an inspirational presence behind that red-shirted backline. Good with his feet and seeming to be constantly oozing with confidence, goalkeepers like Alisson are a rare breed. Liverpool are lucky to have him. 
                    </p>

                <h2>Samir Handanovic </h2>
                <p>Since joining Inter from Udinese nine years ago, the Slovenian has quietly gone about establishing himself as Europe’s top goalkeepers. While he rarely gets the international plaudits he deserves, his consistently assured displays have made him a legend in Milan. The Nerazzurri's first Scudetto in 11 seasons was bagged thanks, in no small part, to the lowest goals against tally in the division. Handanovic's calm leadership was key to that success. 
                    Calm, an excellent communicator and superb in the air, the 36-year-old is an old school type of goalkeeper, who places an emphasis on defending above distribution. His 72.1% save percentage in Serie A is the second best in the division, behind only Genoa's Matter Perin, while his clean sheet haul of 14 is unparalleled in Italian football. 
                    </p>

                <h2>Keylor Navas</h2>
                <p>The Costa Rican has been nothing short of sensational between the sticks for PSG, since joining from Real Madrid in 2019 for just £13m, helping the club to a domestic treble during a COVID-ravaged 19/20 season, as well as the Champions League Final last year. 
                    The 34-year old has kept 14 clean sheets in 24 Ligue 1appearances this season, second only to Lille's Mike Maignan, and has a pass completion rate of 85%, the third highest in the division. A superb all-rounder, Keylor Navas appears to only be getting better with age. 
                    </p>

                <h2>Marc-Andre ter Stegen </h2>
                <p>It takes a hell of a lot for Germans to question a player with the experience and quality of Manuel Neuer but, when it comes to ter Stegen, they’ve been left almost with no choice. How can a player be deemed good enough for the Barcelona no.1 jersey yet not be his national team’s goalkeeper? Much like the more senior Neuer, ter Stegen has taken the modern idea of goalkeeping to a new level. Immaculate with his feet, he is tasked with building Barcelona’s play from the back.
                    After an unconvincing start in Barcelona, ter Stegen is now revered for his goalkeeping ability just as much as his passing. A difficult couple of seasons for everyone at Barcelona - as well as the resurgence of Manuel Neuer (more on him below) - means he will not be Germany's No.1 for the next year at least. He will have his eyes on the 2022 World Cup in Qatar instead

                <h2>Peter Gulasci </h2>
                <p>The signing of Peter Gulasci, from sister club RB Salzburg in 2015, might have been the smartest piece of business Leipzig ever did. Since joining the side for £2m, the Hungarian has been nothing short of sensational over the six seasons since. 
                    Tall, quick off his line, great in the area and a supreme shot-stopper, Gulasci is arguably the best goalkeeper in Germany. His save percentage of 68% is among the best in the division among keepers who regularly start but, in truth, Leipzig’s league best goals against column (just 25 from 31 matches played) has as much to do with his organisational and communication skills as his stopping ability. 
                    Gulasci signed a new deal with Leipzig this week, keeping him at the club until 2025. Fans will be thrilled to know a player who just turned 31 clearly wants to end his career at the Red Bull Area.
